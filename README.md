# 📊 Sales Prediction using Linear Regression

This project predicts advertising-based sales using a linear regression model trained on a dataset with features: **TV, Radio, and Newspaper** budgets.

## 📁 Dataset
- File: `advertising.csv`
- Columns:
  - `TV` — Advertising budget on TV
  - `Radio` — Advertising budget on Radio
  - `Newspaper` — Advertising budget on Newspaper
  - `Sales` — Product sales in units

## 📌 Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## ⚙️ Workflow
1. Loaded and explored the dataset
2. Visualized relationships using pair plots
3. Trained a **Linear Regression** model
4. Evaluated using:
   - **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**: ~1.70
   - **R² Score**: ~0.96
5. Visualized actual vs predicted sales

## 📈 Output
The model demonstrates strong performance and accurately predicts sales based on advertising spend.
